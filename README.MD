# Roots

A webapp cloned from something functional, to test something else entirely.

Clone this branch to a separate repo for shorashim.

Note to be implemented:
* add a view that gets info on shoresh or conjugated forms from online dictionary, and or google translate
* From grid limited list, shlep in other nodes that match connection criterion.
* color the edges based on which letter is mischalef red=p green=e blue=l use cyan magenta yellow white for multi-connections
* Better way to reset the graph or even do it on the fly (check out the older vis project for someones PR for reset)
* tie the results back to attributes of the grid
* put the grid and the diagram on same page
* do the menorah for conjugating shorashim
* especially select one item from graph, and hi

Already implemented:
* removeFree nodes (without connections)
* specify which connections to use
